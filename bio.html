                </h2>
                <p>First and foremost, thank you for visiting my website! I hope you see something here that inspires you in some way. My name
                is Nicki and I absolutely love programming. I’m a little quirky, a lot bubbly, and obsessed with learning new things and
                meeting new people.</p>
                <p>I tend to collect hobbies and pour myself into them. I’ve been a member of a Dragon Boat team, where
                in 6 months I went from being a total noob to being the lead stroke in competitions.

                I started a small film production company called Jump Ship Productions
                and went on to win dozens of awards like best sci-fi at the Phoenix Comicon in 2013. I even learned how to construct a mold to mass
                produce masks that would turn an actor into a talking pie for a film.

                <br>
                When I make up my mind to do something, I put everything
                I have into it and do it right. </p> 
                <p>In 2015 I stumbled upon the HTML and CSS classes on Khan Academy and decided to give it a
                try. I was absolutely hooked. I did online courses here and there, but wasn’t sure where to start to get myself prepared
                for an actual career.</p> 
                <p>In the summer of 2017, after conducting a ton of research, I signed up for a 24 week coding bootcamp
                through the University of Arizona. I thought I loved programming before I started this class, but I had no clue that it would
                truly become my life’s passion. 
                <img src="img/bootcamp.jpg" alt="pie face" class="img-thumbnail">

                I worked hard every day, and excelled enough that my instructor and student success manager
                both submitted my name with high recommendations to be a TA for the next coming semester. I am proud to say that I was offered the position
                and will be spending the first half of 2018 enriching the minds of the next generation of programmers.</p> 
                <p.>As I’ve stated before, when I love something I really put everything I have into it. Lucky for me, programming is something
                that always offers tons of new stuff to learn and master. I can’t wait to see all the amazing things I’m going to make. I hope you will
                come on this journey with me</p>
